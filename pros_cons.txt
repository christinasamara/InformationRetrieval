Basic List Structure (as shown above):

Pros: Simple and easy to work with, especially for smaller datasets. Suitable for scenarios where quick prototyping and simplicity are prioritized.
Cons: May not be as efficient for very large collections, especially when it comes to fast retrieval and scalability.



Inverted Index:

Pros: Offers efficient and fast retrieval. Suitable for large-scale information retrieval systems. Enables quick identification of documents containing specific terms.
Cons: Requires more complex data structures and preprocessing. May have higher upfront costs in terms of implementation.



CSV or Other Structured File Format:

Pros: Can be useful for scenarios where you want to store additional metadata or features along with the text content. Allows for more structured data representation.
Cons: Might introduce some overhead in terms of file I/O, and the efficiency depends on the specific use case.
